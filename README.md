- Mobile-first workflow
- Vue.js - JS library

## What I learned
This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of Vue.js and responsive design. Some key learnings include:

Implementing game logic in Vue.js

Managing state across components

Creating a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile

Handling user interactions and providing immediate feedback

## Continued development
Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects include:

Improving accessibility features

Implementing more complex animations

Exploring state management solutions like Vuex for larger applications

## Challenges faced and solutions

Responsive Design: One of the main challenges was creating a layout that worked well on both desktop and mobile. I overcame this by using flexbox and media queries, and by carefully adjusting the sizing and positioning of elements for different screen sizes.

Game Logic: Implementing the game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was more complex than a traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I solved this by creating a clear data structure that defined the relationships between the different choices.

State Management: Keeping track of the game state and score required careful consideration. I used Vue's reactive data properties to manage this effectively.

CSS Styling: Creating the pentagon layout for the choices was challenging. I used absolute positioning and careful calculations to achieve the desired layout.

Performance: Ensuring the game ran smoothly, especially the animations, required optimization. I used Vue's built-in transition system and carefully managed when components were updated.
